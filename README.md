# WIPS Certificate Generator

A simple and responsive web app that lets users create and download personalized certificates in seconds.  
It was built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS to keep everything fast, clean, and modern.

The idea was to make a tool that allows anyone to type in their name and instantly see it appear on a designed certificate.  
Once the name shows up, users can view it, and if they want, download it as a PDF file — all within the browser.
